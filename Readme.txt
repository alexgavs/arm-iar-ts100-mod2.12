mod.v2.12 (20170412) 
1, Added voltmeter mode, now it is possible to monitor the input voltage.

V2.12 update content (20160606)
1, set the temperature can be saved.

V2.11 update content (20150803)
1, optimize the key delay processing;
2, optimize the display processing;
3, optimize the high temperature alarm;
4, to improve the alarm the highest voltage;
5, the new screen saver function, enter the standby interface for some time, the screen will turn off their own, press the button or move the iron screen will automatically light;
6, optimize the mobile decision.

V2.10 update content (20150714)
1, the temperature calibration did not refresh the bug;
2, to cancel the USB power supply into the thermometer function.

V2.09 update content (20150626)
1, optimize the thermostat algorithm;
2, to improve the alarm the highest voltage.

V2.08 update content (20150616)
1, in the thermometer mode, after calibration or stay in the thermometer mode.

V2.07 update content (20150605)
1, repair the thermometer back to the standby button BUG;
2, U disk file compatible with the previous firmware generated TXT file;
3, dormant state, the iron indicates the color display;
4, U disk into the file named LOGOIN.BMP file, will be displayed in the soldering iron (LOGOIN.BMP for the monochrome, size 96 * 16);
5, USB power supply can also enter the thermometer mode.

V2.06 update content (20150528)
1, optimize the U disk read and write, and now can be placed in other files, and will not delete (there is config file) and U disk size for the actual size (8K);
2, optimize the thermometer function (calculation, display, state transition);
3, in the thermometer state, long press any key to return to standby, while long press the double key for the temperature calibration (need to calibrate at room temperature), calibration success and failure have a corresponding prompt, calibration is complete, return to standby;
4, tip failure (sen-err), over-temperature fault (waring) will be distinguished;
5, U disk file the last one for the calibration AD value, can not be changed.
;
